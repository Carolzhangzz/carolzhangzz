## 🧭 Research Focus

My work centers on **Human–AI Interaction** and **AI for Social Good**, 
with a focus on designing intelligent systems that are socially aware, 
behaviorally grounded, and interaction-driven.

I build and study **conversational and multimodal AI agents** that support:
- behavior reflection
- attitude change
- decision awareness
- sustainability-oriented interaction

My research integrates:
NLP · Interactive Systems · Behavioral Modeling · Agent-based Design
