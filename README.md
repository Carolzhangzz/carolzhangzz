### 🧠 What I Do

I'm a CS Master's student at **UC San Diego**, working at the [Design Lab](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/) with Prof. Steven Dow.

I design AI systems that don't just *respond* — they **intervene**. My conversational agents use NLP and prompt engineering to nudge people toward better environmental decisions, wrapped in games compelling enough that players don't realize they're being studied.

Currently exploring: `Reinforcement Learning` · `World Models`
